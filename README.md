# webpack-boilerplate-react

After using the Parcel bundler for nearly every project I decided to give webpack a try. This is a boilerplate supporting all the coolest functionalities of Webpack 4 shown in its documentation as well as React + Redux + Jest + PWA support.

* * *

### Usage:

Download or clone this repository so you can run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run dev` - starts a dev server on localhost:1234 
`npm run build` - builds and optimized bundle
`npm run serve` - serves ./dist on your local network
`npm run test` - runs Jest for testing
`npm run testwatch` - like above but in watch mode

* * *

### The features include:

*   Pretty much all the cool stuff Webpack 4 can do as shown in its documentation
*   Generating service workers to cache website assets and enable PWA support
*   Ready out of the box project files using React + styled-components + Redux to quickly get you started
*   Dev-server with HMR
*   Code splitting with import()
*   Turning smaller images into Base64 strings
*   Configured Jest with Enzyme for testing (the demo one tests a React component)
*   Cool bundle analyzer
*   PostCSS and Babel to minify and transpile all your JS and CSS fiiles and allow you to use the latest features.
*   Useful libraries such as lodash and superagent listed in package.json
